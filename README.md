# wepay-api-node

Welcome to the wepay-api-node library! More details will appear here as the
project matures into something that can actually be used.

## Getting a copy

Stable releases will be published to the npm database each time they are
released. You can get them by running `npm install wepay-api` or adding
a dependency to your package.json file.

## Version Numbers

This application mostly follows semantic versioning. Changes in the patch number
simply represent small changes (usually bugfixes). Changes in the minor
version number represent potentially breaking changes and new features
without any major changes to the API structure. The major version changing
signifies me thinking this project has reached a superb level of maturity.
